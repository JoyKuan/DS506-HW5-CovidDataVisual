#### Author: Kuan-Hui Lin
#### Operating system: MacOS Catalina v10.15


# How to install and run your visualization with Bokeh
### Step 1. Clone "DS560-HW5-CovidDataVisual" into a directory using `git clone <url>`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoyKuan/DS506-HW5-CovidDataVisual.git
```
### Step 2. Create a new environment on your machine and install the dependencies necessary for running the Bokeh dashboard

* **Create a new environment on your machine**
  If you want to create a virtual environment, changing your current working directory by using "cd" command into DS506-HW5-CovidDataVisual you cloned from step   1, and then install virtualenv first. (If you already have virtualenv, just skip creating virtualenv step.)
  ```bash
  pip install virtualenv
  ```
  Then, creating a virtual environment which is named dsci560H5:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv dsci560H5
  ```
  If all steps mentioned above are not failure, activate your virtual environment by using this command
  ```bash
  source dsci560H5/bin/activate
  ```
  and you will see

* **Install the dependencies**
  Install the dependencies which are included in requirements.txt before executing the python script:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  If you install the dependencies on your virtual environment successfully, you will see

### Step 3. Run the python script on a Bokeh server
To run a Bokeh application on a Bokeh server from a single Python script (covid_data_visual.py), pass the script name to `<bokeh serve>`on the command line:
```bash
bokeh serve --show covid_data_visual.py 
```
-- show: It will raise a browser to the correct location for you and you will see the dashboard visualizations.
